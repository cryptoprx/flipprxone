### What is SnapTap?

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Is FLIPPRX ONE secure?
Yes! FLIPPRX ONE uses:
- AES-256-GCM encryption (military-grade)
- Client-side only architecture
- No server-side key storage
- SnapTap dual-key authentication
- Open source code for transparency

### Can FLIPPRX ONE access my funds?
No. FLIPPRX ONE is 100% self-custodial. Your private keys are encrypted and stored only on your device. We cannot access your funds under any circumstances.

### What if I lose my seed phrase?
Unfortunately, if you lose your seed phrase and lose access to your device, your funds cannot be recovered. This is the nature of self-custodial wallets. Always keep secure backups!

### Where are my private keys stored?
Your private keys are encrypted and stored locally in your browser's secure storage. They never leave your device and are never transmitted to any server.

### What data does FLIPPRX ONE collect?
None! We don't collect:
- Private keys or seed phrases
- Personal information
- Transaction history
- Usage analytics
- IP addresses
- Any identifying data

### How do I keep my wallet secure?
**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Write down your seed phrase on paper
- ✅ Store backups in multiple secure locations
- ✅ Use SnapTap authentication
- ✅ Keep your device secure
- ✅ Verify addresses before sending
- ❌ Never share your seed phrase
- ❌ Never store seed phrase digitally

### What is the difference between SnapTap and password?
- **SnapTap**: Dual-key authentication requiring both device + NFC/biometric. Maximum security, phishing-resistant.
- **Password**: Traditional password-based encryption. Simpler but less secure than SnapTap.

## 💼 Wallet Management

### How do I view my balance?
Your XRP and token balances are displayed on the main dashboard. They update automatically every 10 seconds, or you can refresh manually.

### What is XRP reserve?
XRPL requires a minimum balance (reserve) to maintain an account. Currently:
- Base reserve: 1 XRP
- Per-trustline: 0.2 XRP
- Per-object: 0.2 XRP

This reserve is locked but still yours - it's not a fee.

### How do I add tokens to my wallet?
1. Go to Trustline Manager
2. Select the token you want to add
3. Click "Create Trustline"
4. Approve the transaction
5. The token will appear in your balance

### Can I have multiple wallets?
Yes! You can create or import multiple wallets and switch between them easily.

### How do I backup my wallet?
Your seed phrase IS your backup. Write it down on paper and store it securely. You can restore your entire wallet using just the seed phrase.

### Can I change my password?
Yes, but this creates a new encryption layer. Your seed phrase remains the same and can always restore your wallet.

2. Enter recipient address
3. Enter amount

### What are transaction fees?
XRPL fees are extremely low, typically 0.00001 XRP (a fraction of a cent). FLIPPRX ONE automatically calculates the optimal fee.

### How long do transactions take?
XRPL transactions typically confirm in 3-5 seconds. You'll see confirmation almost immediately.

### Can I cancel a transaction?
No. Once a transaction is submitted to the XRPL network, it cannot be cancelled or reversed. Always double-check before confirming!

### What is a destination tag?
A destination tag is an additional identifier used by exchanges and services to route payments to specific accounts. Always include it when sending to exchanges.
